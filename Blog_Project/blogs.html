                    <h2>Some CSS Tricks</h2>
                    <p>
                        While there are a number of frameworks and libraries that assist with the development of a website,
                        it's good practice to be able to handle styling in a tact and flexible way for those niche moments
                        that may come your way. One such common trick to use in CSS is the 'vh' or 'view height' attribute 
                        to get the element to fill the entire screen, at least from a vertical perspective. To apply vh you 
                        would precede the attribute with the percentage of the fill as seen below.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>.myheight{height: 90vh;} //for 90% of the screen height</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This can be tricky to use given the wide array of screens that the content could be spread over. As 
                        such consideration needs to be made to media query values. An additional little trick is to use the 
                        ":before" and ":after" selectors to dynamically add additional content to a collection of sections.
                        This could be a special postmark, logo, or text notice. Say a restaurant was fielding their menu on 
                        their site and wanted a chile logo before certain menu items they could apply the ":before" selector 
                        to each menu item that's exceptionally spicy. The CSS could look like this with the assumption that 
                        the menu items are partitioned into divs.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>.spicy_foods:before{content:url(./chile.png);}</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In a similar example one could apply ":after" to apply anchor links to send the user back to the start
                        of the page on demand. Such selectors and their possibilities are often overlooked within web styling.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future of JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is dominating with respect to the field of web development. Indeed it seems to have become a 
                        central component in the larger web ecosystem, but has it peaked in terms of its utility or has JavaScript 
                        only just hit its stride? There are some machinations in the shadows that may support the latter notion. 
                        These developments include the coming of TensorFlow.js, further advancements in the JavaScript engine V8,
                        and the stable release of the JavaScript superset TypeScript. The future of technology is increasingly 
                        resting on the idea of machine learning with neural networks being a keystone aspect of the field. 
                        TensorFlow.js provides the power of neural nets towards learning paradigms that could actively divine 
                        incredible analysis in elements such as network traffic and client behavioral patterns. While still in its infancy,
                        pre-learned net conversion and visualization are recent features, TensorFlow.js can blossom into a powerhouse
                        of information procurement thus advancing JavaScript as a premiere programming language on the web. With regard to
                        advancements in the V8 engine which has helped elevate the relevancy of Node.j, it has only begun receiving major
                        optimizations to bring it up to speed with other languages. As a loosely typed language, JavaScript is subject to 
                        marginally less quick compilation but V8 additions such as TurboFan are providing just-in-time compilation. This 
                        appears to be a part of a larger trend where in bottlenecks are being removed and JavaScript's hinderances are being 
                        reduced. Finally, there is the entrance of TypeScript into primetime. In spite of annual advancements laid out by the 
                        ECMA standards organization, JavaScript didn't really have a major work horse to enact those advancements. Enter
                        TypeScript which builds out on top of JavaScript with more serious support for object oriented programming and more
                        robust data structures.

                <div class="blog"><!--PHP vs JSP-->
                    <h2>PHP versus JSP</h2>
                    <p>
                        Though it is not the most fair comparison considering Java Server Pages are an abstraction of Java Servlets and PHP, 
                        or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server side scripting language, both are generally used for server-side programming. To 
                        that end, it is worth weighing their merits. Indeed, neither one nor the other could not necessarily be said to better. 
                        On a general level, JSP technology far outweighs PHP in versatility and utility. JSP carries extensive library support,
                        object caching, and session maintenance towards its primary benefit of web dynamism. By this comparison, PHP is a much 
                        lighter package only supporting server-side transactions alongside a few other basic web solutions by extension of 
                        its status as a general programming language. Otherwise, the dominance of one over the other is dependent on the situation.
                        In spite of PHP's lack of robustness, it is also smaller and quicker then the JSP package. This makes PHP more ideal for 
                        smaller applications and/or smaller technologies. To that end, PHP would appear to have a home in the world of IoT. 
                        Outside of the realm of smaller enterprises though, JSP is the obvious choice.
